Ruby Readability

Command line:
  (sudo) gem install ruby-readability

Bundler:
  gem "ruby-readability", :require => 'readability'

Example:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'readability'
  require 'open-uri'

  source = open('http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/').read
  puts Readability::Document.new(source).content

Options:

  You may provide additions options to Readability::Document.new, including:

    :tags               - the base whitelist of tags to sanitize, defaults to %w[div p]
    :remove_empty_nodes - remove <p> tags that have no text content; this will also remove p tags that contain only images
    :attributes         - whitelist of allowed attributes
    :debug              - provide debugging output, defaults false
    :encoding           - if this page is of a known encoding, you can specify it; if left unspecified, the encoding will be guessed (only in Ruby 1.9.2)
    :html_headers       - in Ruby 1.9.2 these will be passed to the guess_html_encoding gem to aid with encoding guessing

Readability comes with a command-line tool for experimentation in bin/readability.

  Usage: readability [options] URL
